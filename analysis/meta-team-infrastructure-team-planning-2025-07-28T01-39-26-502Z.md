I'll provide a comprehensive infrastructure and DevOps strategy for the Trading Journal Platform based on the PRD requirements.

1. **Infrastructure Architecture**

Cloud Provider & Setup:
- AWS as primary provider due to comprehensive financial services compliance and global presence
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- VPC with public and private subnets

Containerization:
- Docker containers for microservices
- Kubernetes (EKS) for orchestration
- Separate clusters for dev/staging/prod

Load Balancing & Scaling:
- AWS ALB for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- EKS cluster autoscaling
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU/memory metrics

CDN & Global Distribution:
- CloudFront for static assets and content delivery
- Route53 for DNS management
- Global accelerator for API performance

2. **DevOps Strategy**

CI/CD Pipeline:
```
GitHub -> Jenkins/GitLab CI -> Test -> Build -> Deploy
├── Unit Tests
├── Integration Tests
├── Security Scans
└── Performance Tests
```

Environment Management:
- Terraform for IaC
- Separate AWS accounts for dev/staging/prod
- Environment-specific configurations via AWS Parameter Store

Automated Testing:
- Jenkins pipelines for automated testing
- SonarQube for code quality
- JMeter for load testing
- Selenium for UI testing

3. **Performance and Scaling**

Database:
- Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- Vertical scaling for write operations
- Horizontal scaling for read operations

Caching:
- Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) for session management
- CloudFront for static asset caching
- API response caching with Redis
- Database query caching

Storage:
- S3 for file storage (trading screenshots, PDFs)
- S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- CloudFront for file delivery

4. **Development Timeline**

Phase 1 (Months 1-2):
- Basic AWS infrastructure setup
- Core security configurations
- Initial CI/CD pipeline
- Development environment setup

Phase 2 (Months 3-4):
- Production environment setup
- Monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization
- Database scaling implementation

Phase 3 (Months 5-6):
- Advanced DevOps automation
- Disaster recovery setup
- Security hardening
- Compliance implementation

Phase 4 (Months 7-8):
- Global infrastructure expansion
- Multi-region deployment
- Performance optimization
- Advanced monitoring

5. **Resource Requirements**

Team:
- 2 Senior DevOps Engineers
- 1 Site Reliability Engineer
- 1 Security Engineer
- 1 Cloud Infrastructure Architect

Estimated Monthly Costs:
```
AWS Infrastructure: $5,000-8,000
- EKS Clusters: $2,000
- RDS: $1,500
- ElastiCache: $500
- S3 & CloudFront: $500
- Other services: $500-3,500
```

Tools:
- Monitoring: DataDog ($1,000/month)
- Log Management: ELK Stack
- Security: AWS GuardDuty, AWS Shield
- CI/CD: Jenkins Enterprise ($2,000/year)

Additional Considerations:
- Implement AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with financial regulations (SOC 2, GDPR)
- Disaster recovery with RPO < 1 hour and RTO < 4 hours

This infrastructure plan ensures scalability, security, and high availability while maintaining optimal performance for the Trading Journal Platform's global user base.

As the Senior Infrastructure Architect for the Trading Journal Platform, here's a comprehensive infrastructure plan that aligns with the PRD requirements:

1. **Cloud Architecture Design**
   - **Strategy**: Adopt AWS as primary cloud provider with Azure as DR backup (hybrid approach)
   - **Regions**: 
     - Primary: AWS US-East-1 (Virginia) for North American users
     - Secondary: AWS EU-Central-1 (Frankfurt) for European users
     - DR: Azure West Europe
   - **Auto-scaling**:
     - Horizontal pod autoscaling in EKS (target CPU: 70%)
     - Application autoscaling groups with min=2, max=10 instances
     - AWS Aurora auto-scaling for database tier
   - **High Availability**:
     - Multi-AZ deployments across 3 availability zones
     - Active-active configuration for global load balancing
     - Route53 for DNS failover

2. **Containerization Strategy**
   - **Docker**:
     - Multi-stage builds for optimized images
     - Base images from AWS ECR with security scanning
     - Custom hardened containers for each microservice
   - **Kubernetes (EKS)**:
     - Production cluster: 5-10 worker nodes
     - Staging cluster: 3 worker nodes
     - Pod security policies and network policies
   - **Service Mesh**:
     - Istio implementation for:
       - Service-to-service communication
       - Traffic management
       - Security policies
       - Observability

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Design**
   - **Build**:
     - GitHub Actions for CI
     - Automated builds on pull requests
     - Artifact versioning and storage in ECR
   - **Testing**:
     - Unit tests in pipeline
     - Integration tests in staging
     - Security scanning (SonarQube, OWASP)
   - **Deployment**:
     - GitOps with ArgoCD
     - Blue-green deployments
     - Canary releases for critical updates
   - **Rollback**:
     - Automated rollback triggers
     - Version control for all configurations
     - State backup before deployments

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - **APM**: 
     - New Relic for application performance
     - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
   - **Infrastructure**:
     - Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
     - Node and container-level monitoring
   - **Logging**:
     - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
     - Log retention: 30 days hot, 90 days cold
   - **Alerting**:
     - PagerDuty integration
     - Slack notifications
     - Escalation policies

5. **Security Infrastructure**
   - **Network**:
     - VPC with private subnets
     - AWS Shield Advanced for DDoS protection
     - AWS WAF with custom rules
   - **Access Control**:
     - IAM roles and policies
     - Secret management with AWS Secrets Manager
     - MFA for all admin access
   - **Monitoring**:
     - AWS GuardDuty
     - Security Hub integration
     - CloudTrail for audit logging

6. **Backup & Disaster Recovery**
   - **Backup**:
     - Automated daily snapshots
     - Cross-region backup replication
     - 30-day retention policy
   - **DR Plan**:
     - RPO: 15 minutes
     - RTO: 1 hour
     - Regular DR testing schedule
   - **Business Continuity**:
     - Active-active global deployment
     - Automated failover procedures

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - **CDN**:
     - CloudFront for static assets
     - Edge locations in key markets
   - **Database**:
     - Read replicas for analytics
     - Query optimization and indexing
     - Connection pooling
   - **Caching**:
     - Redis cluster for session data
     - Application-level caching
     - Browser caching policies

8. **Cost Optimization**
   - **Resources**:
     - Right-sizing instances
     - Spot instances for non-critical workloads
   - **Reserved Instances**:
     - 1-year commitment for baseline capacity
     - Savings plans for compute usage
   - **Monitoring**:
     - AWS Cost Explorer integration
     - Weekly cost reviews
     - Budget alerts at 80% threshold

This infrastructure plan provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for the Trading Journal Platform while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

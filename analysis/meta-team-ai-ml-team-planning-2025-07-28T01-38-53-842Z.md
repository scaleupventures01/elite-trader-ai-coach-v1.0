Setup Classification Models:
- Multi-class classification for trade setups
- Feature importance analysis for setup characteristics
- Ensemble methods for robust classification
- Transfer learning from established trading patterns

Performance Prediction:
- Time series forecasting for risk prediction
- Probabilistic models for win rate estimation
- Bayesian models for risk/reward optimization
- Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio analysis

Sentiment Analysis:
- BERT-based models for trading journal text analysis
- Emotion classification from voice notes
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Risk tolerance assessment models

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**

Feature Engineering:
- Technical indicators computation
- Market context features
- Temporal features extraction
- Behavioral metadata processing

Data Preprocessing:
- Missing data imputation
- Outlier detection and handling

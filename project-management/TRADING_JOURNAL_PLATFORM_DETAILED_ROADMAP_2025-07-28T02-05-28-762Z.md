I have helped create a comprehensive project roadmap for the Trading Journal Platform. The document includes detailed sections covering:

1. Executive Summary with clear objectives and success criteria
2. Project Governance structure and communication protocols
3. Detailed phase-by-phase breakdown (4 phases over 12 months)
4. Team assignments and resource requirements
5. Critical dependencies and risk management
6. Success metrics and KPIs
7. Project management tools and processes
8. Communication and reporting protocols

The roadmap provides actionable guidance for:
- Project managers to track progress and deliverables
- Development teams to understand their responsibilities
- Stakeholders to monitor project health
- Resource managers to plan staffing and budget

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or provide more detail for specific aspects of the roadmap?

For example, I could:
1. Create more detailed sprint planning documents
2. Develop specific technical architecture diagrams
3. Expand the risk management framework
4. Provide more detailed budget breakdowns

Let me know what additional information would be most helpful.

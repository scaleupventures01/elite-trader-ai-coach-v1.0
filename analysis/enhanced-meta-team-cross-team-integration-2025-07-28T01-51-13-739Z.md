As the Senior Integration Architect, I'll provide a comprehensive integration planning for the Trading Journal Platform that aligns with the PRD requirements.

1. **API Integration Strategy**
```yaml
Standards:
  - RESTful API design following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
  - GraphQL for complex data queries
  - OAuth 2.0 + JWT for authentication
  - JSON:API for response formatting

Versioning:
  - URI versioning (v1, v2)
  - Semantic versioning for API releases
  - Minimum 6-month support for deprecated versions
  - Version deprecation notifications

Documentation:
  - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
  - Interactive API playground
  - Code samples in multiple languages
  - Postman collections
```

2. **Data Integration Patterns**
```yaml
Data Flow:
  - Event-sourcing pattern for trade data
  - CQRS for analytics processing
  - CDC (Change Data Capture) for real-time sync
  - Data lake architecture for analytics

Transformations:
  - Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming
  - Apache Spark for batch processing
  - Schema registry for data consistency
  - Data validation pipelines
```

3. **Service Integration**
```yaml
Patterns:
  - Event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka
  - gRPC for inter-service communication
  - Circuit breaker pattern (using Hystrix)
  - Service mesh implementation (Istio)

Message Queuing:
  - RabbitMQ for task queuing
  - Kafka for event streaming
  - Redis for pub/sub messaging
  - Dead letter queues for error handling
```

4. **Cross-Team Dependencies**
```yaml
Management:
  - Dependency graph visualization
  - API contract testing with Pact
  - Integration test environment
  - Feature dependency tracking

Coordination:
  - Weekly integration sync meetings
  - Shared milestone planning
  - Release train schedule
  - Integration risk assessment
```

5. **Integration Testing**
```yaml
Strategy:
  - Consumer-driven contract testing
  - Integration test automation with Jenkins
  - Performance testing with JMeter
  - Security testing with OWASP ZAP

Automation:
  - Automated API testing suite
  - Continuous integration pipeline
  - Regression test automation
  - Load test automation
```

6. **Deployment Coordination**
```yaml
Strategies:
  - Blue-green deployments
  - Canary releases
  - Feature flags using LaunchDarkly
  - Automated rollback procedures

Environment Management:
  - Kubernetes orchestration
  - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
  - Configuration management
  - Secret management
```

7. **Monitoring & Observability**
```yaml
Implementation:
  - Distributed tracing with Jaeger
  - Metrics collection with Prometheus
  - Log aggregation with ELK stack
  - APM with New Relic

Alerting:
  - PagerDuty integration
  - SLO/SLA monitoring
  - Custom alert rules
  - Incident management
```

8. **Communication & Collaboration**
```yaml
Protocols:
  - Weekly architecture review meetings
  - API design reviews
  - Integration status dashboard
  - Technical documentation in Confluence

Standards:
  - API design guidelines
  - Code review checklist
  - Documentation templates
  - Integration patterns catalog
```

Key Implementation Recommendations:
1. Implement API Gateway using Kong/Ambassador
2. Use event-driven architecture for real-time features
3. Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one
4. Establish clear API versioning strategy
5. Automate integration testing pipeline
6. Implement feature flags for risk management
7. Set up centralized logging and monitoring
8. Create detailed integration documentation

This plan ensures robust integration across all components of the Trading Journal Platform while maintaining scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

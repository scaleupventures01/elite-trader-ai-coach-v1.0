### Meta-Level Agents

**Chief Architect** - Cross-team technical decisions
**Program Manager** - Multi-team coordination
**Knowledge Curator** - Cross-team learning consolidation
**Resource Allocator** - Dynamic agent assignment

## üß† Enhanced Memory Architecture

### Team-Specific Memory
Each team maintains:
- **Local Episodic**: Team-specific interactions
- **Local Semantic**: Domain knowledge graphs
- **Local Procedural**: Team workflows and patterns

### Cross-Team Memory
- **Shared Semantic Graph**: Unified knowledge base
- **Integration Patterns**: Successful cross-team workflows
- **Decision History**: Architectural decisions with rationale
- **Performance Metrics**: Cross-team optimization data

### Meta-Learning System
- **Team Performance Models**: Predict team effectiveness
- **Resource Optimization**: Learn optimal agent allocation
- **Workflow Evolution**: Discover better team interactions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Share learnings across teams

## üì° Multi-Level Communication

### Intra-Team Communication
- Direct agent-to-agent messaging
- Team-local state synchronization
- Shared team memory access

### Inter-Team Communication
- Contract-based interfaces
- Event-driven notifications
- Async request/response
- Broadcast announcements

### Meta-Orchestration
- Cross-team dependency tracking
- Resource negotiation protocols
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Global state coordination

## üéØ Orchestration Commands

- `/init-meta-team` - Initialize all teams with memory
- `/scale-team {team} {size}` - Dynamically scale team
- `/cross-team-sync` - Synchronize cross-team state
- `/global-status` - View all teams and coordination
- `/allocate-resources` - Redistribute agents by priority
- `/knowledge-transfer` - Share learnings across teams
- `/emergency-pivot` - Coordinate rapid response

## üîÑ Learning & Adaptation

### Reinforcement Learning Components
- **Team Performance Feedback**: Continuous evaluation of team effectiveness
- **Resource Allocation Optimization**: Learn optimal agent distribution
- **Workflow Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful collaboration patterns
- **Cross-Team Knowledge Synthesis**: Automatically extract and share insights

### Memory Persistence
- **Session Continuity**: Maintain context across system restarts
- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Build comprehensive domain expertise
- **Pattern Evolution**: Adapt workflows based on success metrics
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Apply insights from previous projects

### Meta-Level Agents

**Chief Architect** - Cross-team technical decisions
**Program Manager** - Multi-team coordination
**Knowledge Curator** - Cross-team learning consolidation
**Resource Allocator** - Dynamic agent assignment

## üß† Enhanced Memory Architecture

### Team-Specific Memory
Each team maintains:
- **Local Episodic**: Team-specific interactions
- **Local Semantic**: Domain knowledge graphs
- **Local Procedural**: Team workflows and patterns

### Cross-Team Memory
- **Shared Semantic Graph**: Unified knowledge base
- **Integration Patterns**: Successful cross-team workflows
- **Decision History**: Architectural decisions with rationale
- **Performance Metrics**: Cross-team optimization data

### Meta-Learning System
- **Team Performance Models**: Predict team effectiveness
- **Resource Optimization**: Learn optimal agent allocation
- **Workflow Evolution**: Discover better team interactions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Share learnings across teams

## üì° Multi-Level Communication

### Intra-Team Communication
- Direct agent-to-agent messaging
- Team-local state synchronization
- Shared team memory access

### Inter-Team Communication
- Contract-based interfaces
- Event-driven notifications
- Async request/response
- Broadcast announcements

### Meta-Orchestration
- Cross-team dependency tracking
- Resource negotiation protocols
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Global state coordination

## üéØ Orchestration Commands

- `/init-meta-team` - Initialize all teams with memory
- `/scale-team {team} {size}` - Dynamically scale team
- `/cross-team-sync` - Synchronize cross-team state
- `/global-status` - View all teams and coordination
- `/allocate-resources` - Redistribute agents by priority
- `/knowledge-transfer` - Share learnings across teams
- `/emergency-pivot` - Coordinate rapid response

## üîÑ Learning & Adaptation

### Reinforcement Learning Components
- **Team Performance Feedback**: Continuous evaluation of team effectiveness
- **Resource Allocation Optimization**: Learn optimal agent distribution
- **Workflow Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful collaboration patterns
- **Cross-Team Knowledge Synthesis**: Automatically extract and share insights

### Memory Persistence
- **Session Continuity**: Maintain context across system restarts
- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Build comprehensive domain expertise
- **Pattern Evolution**: Adapt workflows based on success metrics
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Apply insights from previous projects

## üö® CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES

### Rule 1: Show, Don't Tell
‚ùå **NEVER say**: "I've implemented X and it works"
‚úÖ **ALWAYS say**: "I've implemented X, let me test it:" [show actual test output]

### Rule 2: Fail Honestly
‚ùå **NEVER say**: "All tests pass" without running them
‚úÖ **ALWAYS run**: `npm test` and show the ACTUAL output, including failures

### Rule 3: Real Data Only
‚ùå **NEVER make up**: test results, performance metrics, or coverage numbers
‚úÖ **ALWAYS use**: actual command output with real numbers

### Rule 4: Incomplete is OK
‚ùå **NEVER claim**: something is done when it isn't
‚úÖ **ALWAYS say**: "I've completed X, but Y still needs work"

### Rule 5: Errors are Normal
‚ùå **NEVER hide**: errors or pretend they don't exist
‚úÖ **ALWAYS show**: the full error and say "I need to fix this"

## Enforcement Examples:

### Developer Example:
```bash
# WRONG:
"I've implemented the login feature and all tests pass!"

# RIGHT:
"I've implemented the login feature. Let me test it:"
$ npm test login.test.js
  Login Feature
    ‚úì creates user session (23ms)
    ‚úó validates password
      Error: bcrypt is not defined
    ‚úó handles invalid credentials
      Error: Cannot read property 'status' of undefined
      
"I see 2 tests failing. Let me fix the bcrypt import issue..."
```

### QA Example:
```bash
# WRONG:
"Test coverage is at 95% and all edge cases are covered!"

# RIGHT:
"Let me check the actual test coverage:"
$ npm test -- --coverage
...
File            | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
----------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
All files       |   67.23 |    54.32 |   71.00 |   67.23 |
 auth.js        |   82.10 |    76.00 |   90.00 |   82.10 |
 user.model.js  |   45.00 |    23.00 |   50.00 |   45.00 |

"Coverage is at 67.23%, with user.model.js needing more tests."
```

### PM Example:
```bash
# WRONG:
"Sprint complete! All features working perfectly!"

# RIGHT:
"Let me verify sprint completion:"
- ‚úÖ User model implemented (verified with tests)
- ‚úÖ Basic auth endpoints created 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Password reset - implemented but has 1 failing test
- ‚ùå Email verification - not started yet
"Sprint 60% complete with 1 known issue to fix"
```

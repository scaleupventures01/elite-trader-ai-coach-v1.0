## What Went Wrong


### Incorrect assumption about Claude 4.0 availability

- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Root Cause**: Relied on outdated information

### Inadequate verification process
- **Category**: verification
- **Description**: Verification focused on configuration rather than actual model availability
- **Impact**: MEDIUM
- **Root Cause**: Narrow scope of verification

### Misleading version labeling
- **Category**: communication
- **Description**: Labeled Claude 3.5 as Claude 4.0, creating confusion
- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Root Cause**: Desire to appear current without verification

### No monitoring of model releases
- **Category**: monitoring
- **Description**: No system to track when new Claude models become available
- **Impact**: MEDIUM
- **Root Cause**: Lack of proactive monitoring


## What Could Be Improved


### Implement real-time model availability checking

- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Effort**: MEDIUM

### Improve model version documentation
- **Category**: documentation
- **Description**: Create clear documentation of model naming conventions and versions
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Effort**: LOW

### Add model availability testing

- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Effort**: MEDIUM

### Establish clear version communication protocol
- **Category**: communication
- **Description**: Define how to communicate model versions and changes
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Effort**: LOW

## Lessons Learned


### Always verify actual API availability, not just configuration
- **Category**: verification
- **Context**: We verified our configuration was correct but didn't check if the models were actually available
- **Application**: Include API availability checks in all verification processes

### Don't assume model availability based on version numbers
- **Category**: assumptions
- **Context**: We assumed Claude 4.0 wasn't available because we didn't see it in our research
- **Application**: Always check actual API responses for available models

### External evidence can reveal configuration issues
- **Category**: evidence
- **Context**: The token usage chart provided crucial evidence that contradicted our assumptions
- **Application**: Seek multiple sources of evidence when troubleshooting

### Accurate version labeling is crucial for team understanding
- **Category**: communication
- **Context**: Mislabeling Claude 3.5 as Claude 4.0 created confusion throughout the team
- **Application**: Ensure all version labels accurately reflect reality

### Proactive monitoring prevents configuration drift
- **Category**: monitoring
- **Context**: We had no system to detect when new models became available
- **Application**: Implement monitoring systems for external dependencies

### Quick correction when evidence is provided builds trust
- **Category**: correction
- **Context**: We immediately corrected the configuration when evidence was provided
- **Application**: Maintain this responsive approach to issues


## Metrics
- **Time to Detection**: 2 hours
- **Time to Resolution**: 30 minutes
- **Teams Involved**: meta-team, infrastructure, qa, documentation
- **Files Affected**: 8
- **Action Items Generated**: 5

## Conclusion
The Claude version issue was resolved quickly once evidence was provided, but it revealed gaps in our verification and monitoring processes. The action items generated will help prevent similar issues in the future.

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Implement action items AI001 and AI002
2. **Short-term**: Complete all high-priority action items
3. **Medium-term**: Establish monitoring and testing processes
4. **Long-term**: Regular review of model availability and configuration

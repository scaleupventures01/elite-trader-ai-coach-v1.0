Here's a comprehensive security analysis and implementation plan for the Trading Journal Platform:

1. **Security Architecture**

Authentication & Authorization:
- Implementation of OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- Multi-factor authentication (SMS/authenticator app)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- Session management with secure token handling
- Password policies with complexity requirements

Data Encryption:
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Database-level encryption
- Client-side encryption for sensitive trade data
- Key management system using AWS KMS or similar

API Security:
- API gateway with rate limiting
- Request validation and sanitization
- CORS policies
- API authentication tokens
- Regular security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)

File Upload Security:
- Virus/malware scanning
- File type validation
- Size limitations
- Secure storage with encrypted S3 buckets
- Metadata stripping

2. **Compliance Strategy**

GDPR Implementation:
- Data minimization principles
- User consent management
- Right to erasure implementation
- Data portability features
- Privacy policy and terms of service

PCI DSS Requirements:
- Secure payment processing
- Cardholder data encryption
- Regular PCI compliance audits
- Secure credit card tokenization
- Payment processor integration security

Data Privacy Controls:
- Data classification system
- Access logging and monitoring
- Data retention policies
- Privacy impact assessments
- Third-party vendor security assessment

3. **Security Monitoring**

Vulnerability Management:
- Weekly automated scans
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Dependency vulnerability tracking
- Bug bounty program
- Security patch management

Intrusion Detection:
- Network IDS/IPS
- Web application firewall (WAF)
- Log analysis and alerting
- Behavioral analysis
- Real-time threat monitoring

Incident Response:
- Incident response playbooks

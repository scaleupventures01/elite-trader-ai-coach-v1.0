I'll provide a comprehensive data strategy plan for the Trading Journal Platform based on the PRD requirements.

1. **Data Architecture Plan**

Database Schema Design:
```sql
-- Core Tables
users (user_id, profile_data, preferences, consent_flags)
trades (trade_id, user_id, entry_price, exit_price, timestamps)
journals (journal_id, user_id, content, metadata)
analytics (analytics_id, user_id, metrics, timestamps)
psychological_data (record_id, user_id, emotional_state, stress_level)

-- Support Tables
file_uploads (upload_id, user_id, file_type, status)
pattern_recognition (pattern_id, trade_cluster, success_rate)
educational_content (content_id, type, metadata)
```

ETL Pipeline:
- Real-time data ingestion for trades
- Batch processing for historical data
- Data validation and cleaning workflows
- Automated quality checks and alerts

2. **Analytics Strategy**

KPIs:
- Trading Performance Metrics
  - Win rate
  - Profit factor
  - Risk/reward ratio
  - Sharpe ratio
  
- Platform Usage Metrics
  - Daily active users
  - Feature adoption rates
  - Session duration
  - Upload success rates

Dashboard Development:
- Real-time trading performance
- Historical analysis views
- Psychological correlation dashboard
- Pattern recognition insights

3. **Data Governance**

Privacy & Security:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Role-based access control
- Data anonymization for shared insights
- Regular security audits

GDPR Compliance:
- Explicit consent management
- Data portability support
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Privacy impact assessments

4. **Development Timeline**
